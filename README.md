# Next.js

- React.js full-stack for web-development
- In addition to building UI, next.js also provides features like routing, rendering, optimization, data fetching,etc.
- It uses react server component
- Opinionated framework(file, folder conventions)

## Features

1. Routing: file based routing
2. Rendering: Server-Side rendering (SSR), Client-side rendering (CSR), Static site generation (SSG)
3. Optimization: Image, file
4. Data fetching/File system
5. API routes
6. Styling

## React serverr component

## 1. Server component (default)
- All react component in Next.js are server component by default
- Server side tasks like data fetching, files read, database data fetching, async tasks.
- Cannot use react hooks, events, user interactions,

## 2. Client component
- Can use react hooks, events, user interactions.
- Traditional react components
- Use the directive `use client` at the top of component file

## Routing
- File based routing
- All routes must be inside `src/app` directory
- Every route must have `page.js` or `page.tsx` file
- `page.js` or `page.tsx` must have a default export

1. Simple Routes
- Create a folder inside /src/app and add a page.js file
- /src/app/about/page.js
- /src/app/contact/page.js

2. Nested routes
- Create a folder inside folder for nested routes
- /src/app/courses/frontend/react/page.js
- /src/app/courses/frontend/next/page.js
- /src/app/courses/backend/express/page.js
- /src/app/courses/backend/laravel/page.js

3. Dynamic routes
- Create a folder enclosed by []
- /src/app/products/[id]/page.js


4. Nested Dynamic routes
- /src/app/products/[id]/reviews/[reviewId]/page.js

5. Catch all segments
- /src/app/blogs/[...slug]/page.js

6. Private folders
- /src/app/_folder/

7. Route Groups
- /src/app/(auth)

## Layouts
- UI component that is shared among different pages
- `layout.js` or `layout.tsx`


## Special files of Next.js

- page.js
- layout.js
- not-found.js
- loading.js
- error.js //always client component


## Link 

- <Link> for navigation, similar to <a>
- For programmatic navigation, use the `useRouter` hook.


## Params & SearchParams

1. For server component
- params: dynamic route params, available on page.js & layout.js
- searchParams: query, available on page.js
 
 2. For client component
 - useParams()
 - useSearchParams()


## Metadata
- Metadata api is used to define metadata of the page
- page.js / layout.js
- Useful of search engine optimization (SEO)
- static: metadata
- dynamic: generateMetadata


## Rendering: SSR, CSR, SSG
- Process of converting/transforming component code into UI.
- Client side rendering (CSR) and Server side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG) are generated during app build.
- Note: Components are server side rendered in Next.js, and client side rendered in React.js

## CSR
- If rendering is done in browser -> CSR

## SSR
- If rendering is done in server -> SSR


## React Server Component
## Client Component
- Interactivity
- Event, User interaction
- State management
- To make client component, `use client` directive
- Client components can be both CSR or SSR

## Server Component
- Fetch data from API
- Send API request
- Metadata
- By default, all componets in Next.js are Server component
- Only SSR
